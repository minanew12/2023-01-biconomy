# Biconomy Smart Account (Smart Contract Wallet) Overview

Biconomy Smart Account is a smart contract wallet that builds on core concepts of Gnosis / Argent safes and implements an interface to support calls from [account abstraction](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337) Entry Point contract. We took all the the good parts of existing smart contract wallets.

- Cheap to deploy copies of a base wallet
- Wallet addresses are counterfactual in nature (you can know the address in advance and users will have the same address across all EVM chains)
- Deployment cost can be sponsored (gasless transactions by a relayer)
- Modules can be used to extend the functionality of the smart contract wallet. Concepts like multi-sig, session keys, etc also can be implemented using the MultiSig Module, SessionKey Module & so on.

## Smart Contracts

All the contracts in this section are to be reviewed. Any contracts not in this list are to be ignored for this contest.

#### BaseSmartAccount.sol (51 sloc)

Abstract contract that implements EIP4337 IWallet interface
defines set of methods (compatible with EIP and Biconomy SDK) that all Smart Wallets must implement

#### Proxy.sol (26 sloc)

EIP1167 Proxy

#### SmartAccountFactory.sol (38 sloc)

Contract responsible for deploying smart wallets aka accounts using create2 and create
Has a method to compute counter factual wallet of the address before deploying

```solidity
function deployCounterFactualWallet(address _owner, address _entryPoint, address _handler, uint _index) public returns(address proxy)
```

`salt` consists of `_owner` and `_index`. `_entryPoint` and `_handler` are required to init the wallet.
(contest bonus : showcase any potential front running in wallet deployment)

#### SmartAccount.sol (332 sloc)

Base implementation contract for smart wallet

reference 1 : <https://docs.gnosis-safe.io/contracts>

reference 2 : <https://github.com/eth-infinitism/account-abstraction/blob/develop/contracts/samples/SimpleAccount.sol>

notes:

1) reverting methods are used for gas estimations
2) transactions happen via EOA signature by calling execTransaction or validateUserOp and execFromEntryPoint via entry point
3) currently 1-1 multisig
4) ECDSA used for signature verification. contract signatures are supported using EIP1271 (we encourage wardens to test integration of smart contract wallet for providing signature on protocols like opensea)

#### EntryPoint.sol (344 sloc)

EIP4337 Entry Point contract (<https://blog.openzeppelin.com/eth-foundation-account-abstraction-audit/>)

#### StakeManager.sol (76 sloc)

Stake Manager for wallet and paymaster deposits / stakes
<https://blog.openzeppelin.com/eth-foundation-account-abstraction-audit/>

#### Executor.sol (25 sloc)

helper contract to make calls and delegatecalls to dapp contracts

#### FallbackManager.sol (34 sloc)

Fallback manager manages a fallback handler to fallback to (delegate call) when a method is not found in wallet implementation contract

#### ModuleManager.sol (75 sloc)

Gnosis Safe module manager

#### DefaultCallbackHandler.sol (50 sloc)

Manages hooks to react to receiving tokens

#### MultiSend.sol (35 sloc)

Allows to batch multiple transactions into one. Relayer -> Smart Wallet - > MultiSend -> Dapp contract / contracts

#### MultiSendCallOnly.sol (30 sloc)

MultiSend functionality but reverts if a transaction tries to do delegatecall

#### VerifyingSingletonPaymaster.sol (74 sloc)

A paymaster that uses external service to decide whether to pay for the UserOp. The paymaster trusts an external signer to sign the transaction. The calling user must pass the UserOp to that external signer first, which performs whatever off-chain verification before signing the UserOp. Singleton Paymaster is Biconomy Paymaster which can be used by all the Dapps and manages gas accounting for their corresponding paymasterId.

#### PaymasterHelpers.sol (29 sloc)

Library useful for decoding paymaster data and context

## Architecture

<https://github.com/eth-infinitism/account-abstraction/tree/develop/eip/assets/eip-4337>

public document for Biconomy SDK that uses these smart contract wallets and account abstraction EIP4337
<https://www.notion.so/biconomy/Biconomy-SDK-adf0c6cedb08436097bf099b8f46aac7>

Transactional level methods are either called on EntryPoint.sol -> handleOps() or on SmartAccount.sol (delegated through Proxy.sol) -> execTransaction()

# Scope

## SCW (wallet-contracts)

These contracts uses EIP1167 minimal proxy (`Proxy.sol`) to deploy a clone of implementation contract (`SmartAccount.sol`)
The factory contract that is responsible for deploying a smart contract wallet is SmartAccountFactory.sol which has methods to getCounterFactualWalletAddress and deploy wallet (using CREATE2)

SmartAccount follows the IAccount interface proposed by EIP4337 <https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337>

**Account abstraction BasePaymaster and Biconomy Singleton Paymaster**

(Paymaster is a special contract that acts as a Gas Tank to sponsor the user operations, that pre deposits native token gas on the EntryPoint contract (which in turn refunds the relayer/bundler). Biconomy uses a specific paymaster implementation called VerifyingPaymaster where an off-chain signature is passed to be verified for gas sponsorship within the contract)
